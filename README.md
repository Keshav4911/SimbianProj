# 🛡️ Simbian Security Experience – Before & After Interactive UI

This project is a frontend assignment showcasing the contrast between security operations **“Without Simbian” vs “With Simbian”**, built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. The goal was to build a clean, interactive, and responsive experience across devices that tells a compelling visual story.

### 💡 Thought Process
The core idea was to highlight inefficiencies and alert chaos in a "Without Simbian" environment, and then transition to a smooth, AI-driven experience in the "With Simbian" section. I focused on dynamic content, real-time dummy alerts, and engaging animations to represent alert fatigue, misclassifications, and threats in motion — all tying back to the core theme. The structure is modular and scalable, with reusable components and responsive layouts that maintain a sleek UX across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 🎞️ Animation Library Used
I used **Framer Motion** to handle all entrance, exit, count-up animations, alert droppings, shake/glow effects, and the final “success checkmarks.” It allowed me to fine-tune motion and state transitions in a smooth and performant way.

### 🛠️ Known Issues / Improvements for the Future
- Alert data is currently dummy/randomized — hooking this to live or simulated data would improve realism.
- Some animations could be further optimized for performance on low-end mobile devices.
- More polish could be added to storytelling transitions, like a timeline scroll or micro-interaction-based triggers.
